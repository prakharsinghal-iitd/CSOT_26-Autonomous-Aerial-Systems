## 🎯 What You Will Build

By the end of Week 5, you will have a **single, cohesive Simulink project** that:

- Models the full **6-DOF flight dynamics** of a quadcopter
- Simulates a **realistic sensor suite** (IMU, barometer, magnetometer) with noise and bias
- Runs a **cascaded PID controller** for altitude hold and attitude stabilisation
- Uses an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** for sensor fusion — no true states fed to the controller
- Executes a **3-waypoint autonomous GPS mission** with a 3 m/s crosswind active
- Passes a formal **Requirements Verification Matrix** against 8 system requirements

This mirrors exactly the workflow used at aerospace companies (Boeing, Airbus, NASA JPL, DJI) and is directly aligned with the **inter-IIT Tech Meet Aerial domain** challenge format.

## 📐 System Requirements (R1–R8)

These are the 8 formal requirements your autopilot must satisfy. Every week builds toward verifying them.

| ID | Requirement | Pass Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **R1** | Altitude hold — maintain altitude during hover | Within ±0.3 m |
| **R2** | Attitude control — reject disturbances on roll/pitch | Within ±5° |
| **R3** | Disturbance rejection — stable flight in crosswind | Stable at 3 m/s |
| **R4** | Sensor noise tolerance — correct operation with IMU noise & bias | Operates correctly |
| **R5** | Autonomous navigation — 3-waypoint GPS mission | All 3 WPs reached |
| **R6** | State estimation — position/velocity via EKF | Error reported in m |
| **R7** | Graceful mode transitions — Takeoff → Hover → Land | No abrupt jumps |
| **R8** | Requirements traceability — all reqs verified via test matrix | Complete pass/fail matrix |

## ⚖️ Rules

1. All Simulink models must run on **MATLAB R2026b** with no missing toolboxes.
2. Submissions after the deadline receive a penalty (leaderboard score deduction).
3. Your `.slx` file must be **self-contained** — no broken paths or missing blocks.
4. You may discuss concepts with peers but all code/models must be your own work.
5. Screenshots must show **your own** MATLAB environment (watermark/username visible).
