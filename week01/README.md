## 🎯 What This Week Is About

Week 1 lays the foundation for the entire program and introduces several core concepts and tools that will be used throughout the upcoming weeks. By the end of Sunday, you are expected to complete the following three tasks:

1. **Installed MATLAB R2026** and verified all required toolboxes.
2. **Written a formal Requirements Document** — the engineering specification your entire project will be tested against in Week 5.
3. **Built your first Simulink model** — a 6-DOF quadcopter dynamics model that you will build on every week from here.

This is the most front-loaded week. Everything in Weeks 2–5 plugs into the model you start here. Take the dynamics model seriously.

## 🔧 Tasks This Week

### Task 1 — Install MATLAB R2026 (1 hour)
**Guide:** [`tasks/Installation.md`](./tasks/Installation.md)

Required toolboxes: Simulink · Control System Toolbox · Aerospace Blockset · Stateflow · Signal Processing Toolbox

**Deliverable:** Screenshot of Simulink Library Browser showing all toolboxes. (1 pt)

---

### Task 2 — Watch Video Resources  (2 hours)
**Guide:** [`tasks/Video Resources.md`](./tasks/Video_Resources.md)

Will be shared shortly

---


### Task 3 — Build the 6-DOF Flight Dynamics Model (2.5 hours)
**Guide:** [`tasks/Flight Dynamics.md`](./tasks/Flight_Dynamics_Model.md)

This is the core engineering task of Week 1. You will build a Simulink model of a quadcopter's flight dynamics from scratch.

**What to build:**
- **Inputs:** 4 individual rotor thrust values (T1, T2, T3, T4)
- **Outputs:** Position [x, y, z], velocity [vx, vy, vz], attitude [roll, pitch, yaw], angular rates [p, q, r]
- **Subsystems:** Force & Torque Mixer → Translational Dynamics → Rotational Dynamics → Kinematics
- **Hover Trim block:** computes the equilibrium rotor speed for steady level flight

**Parameters to use:**
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Mass (m) | 0.5 kg |
| Gravity (g) | 9.81 m/s² |
| Ixx | 4.9 × 10⁻³ kg·m² |
| Iyy | 4.9 × 10⁻³ kg·m² |
| Izz | 8.8 × 10⁻³ kg·m² |
| Thrust coefficient (kT) | 2.9 × 10⁻⁵ N/(rad/s)² |
| Torque coefficient (kQ) | 5.7 × 10⁻⁷ N·m/(rad/s)² |
| Arm length (L) | 0.225 m |

**Trim verification:** Apply hover thrust to all 4 motors. Run the simulation for 5 seconds. Position and attitude must remain constant (within ±0.01 m / ±0.01°). Compute % error between your simulated hover thrust and the analytical value.

**Deliverable:** `autopilot_wk1_YOUR_NAME.slx` + trim results table (10 pts)

## ⏱️ Suggested Time Split (7 hours total)

| Day | Task | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Day 1 | Install MATLAB R2026 + Watch Videos | 2.5 hrs |
| Day 2 | Write answers (this thing is so that u don't forget basics if u are newbie)  | 1.5 hrs |
| Day 3 | Watch Videos + start Simulink model | 2 hrs |
| Day 4 | Complete model, run trim analysis, submit | 1 hr |

## 💡 Tips

- **On the model:** Build one subsystem at a time. Start with the Force & Torque Mixer (pure algebra), then Translational Dynamics, then Rotational Dynamics. Test each subsystem before connecting them.
- **On requirements:** Every requirement must answer: "Can a MATLAB script automatically output PASS or FAIL based on this?" If not, rewrite it.
- **On time:** Task 4 (Simulink) is the hardest. If you're running out of time, submit a partial model with what you have — partial credit is better than nothing.
- **On toolboxes:** Install all 5 toolboxes now. Re-running the installer mid-week costs you an hour you don't have.
